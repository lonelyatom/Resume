The open source version of my Résumé application made over the weekend before my first technical phone interview. The open source version just has my phone number and address extracted from it, but the original application has my address and phone number as well as the ability to call and text me. The purpose of this application is to showcase some of the newer Material Design features, third party libraries, as well as the new Android data binding library for MVVM.
